<p>Hyeshik Chang is a computational biologist focused on systems molecular
biology using high-throughput experiments. Molecular mechanisms in
post-transcriptional regulation and the protein-RNA interaction are the
main interests in his scientific theme.</p>

<p>He was once an active <a href="https://opensource.org/">open-source software</a>
enthusiast in his early days. In the FreeBSD project, he ported hundreds
of software packages for computer networking and scientific computing to
the operating system.  As a member of the CPython core team, he wrote
Unicode encoders for the East Asian languages and some enhancements
to the standard library. His other contributions include several tiny
third-party Python packages and optimized block cipher implementations
in the cryptographic subsystems of Linux and OpenSSL.</p>

<p>After joining the <a href="https://narrykim.org">Narry Kim lab</a>
at Seoul National University, he worked on the
high-throughput analysis for the molecular mechanisms of
<a href="https://www.cell.com/abstract/S0092-8674(12)01234-2">LIN28A</a>,
<a href="https://www.cell.com/abstract/S0092-8674(14)01427-5">TUT4/7</a>,
and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature10198">DICER</a>
using second-generation sequencers. His statistical and
visualization tools enabled high-resolution characterization for
the biological functions of the RNA-binding proteins. Extensive
investigation into the roles of TUT4/7 led to the development of
<a href="https://www.cell.com/molecular-cell/fulltext/S1097-2765(14)00121-X">TAIL-seq</a>.
The new high-throughput poly(A) profiling technology revealed regulatory
mechanisms of poly(A) tails in
<a href="https://www.cell.com/molecular-cell/fulltext/S1097-2765(18)30185-0">vertebrate embryonic development</a>,
<a href="https://www.cell.com/molecular-cell/fulltext/S1097-2765(16)30057-0">cell cycle</a>,
<a href="http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/30/14/1671.abstract">oogenesis</a>,
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41594-020-0427-3">viral infection</a>, etc.</p>

<p>Dr. Chang is leading an interdisciplinary group studying applications
of high-throughput biochemical techniques for molecular biology at
Seoul National University. The group currently works on generating and
interpreting informative signals to identify distinct parts within the
nucleic acids.</p>

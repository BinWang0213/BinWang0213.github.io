I"ã<p>Yoojung Han studied broadly about biochemistry, materials engineering, 
and molecular biology during her B.S. at Seoul National University.
Then, she found her interests in computational biology and bioinformatics, 
and jumped up to the new study field since 2020 summer as a member of Chang lab.
Now, she is developing new methods for RNA nanopore sequencing especially for
higher accuracy, better modification detection, and multiplexing.</p>

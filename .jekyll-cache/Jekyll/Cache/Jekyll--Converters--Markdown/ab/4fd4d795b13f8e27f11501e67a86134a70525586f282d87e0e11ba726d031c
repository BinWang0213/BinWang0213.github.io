I"æ<p>Keewon Sung studied Biophysical Chemistry during his M.S. and Ph.D. at Seoul 
National University. He worked on single-molecule analysis of protein-nucleic 
acid interactions using single-molecule spectroscopic techniques. His Ph.D. work 
revealed dynamic molecular mechanisms underlying 1) the target specificity of the
CRISPR-Cas9 nuclease, which enabled rational design of specificity-improved Cas9 
variants, and 2) the BRCA2-telomeric G-quadruplex interaction, which allowed 
molecular understanding of telomere maintenance.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, he also received training for single-cell molecular mechanobiology at 
Johns Hopkins University, USA, as a visiting scientist. During that time, he 
became interested in high-throughput methods for systems molecular biology.</p>

<p>In 2021, he joined the Chang lab as a postdoctoral fellow. His current research
focuses on the development of a breakthrough methodology for nanopore direct RNA
sequencing. By combining novel biochemical/biophysical and computational approaches, 
he aims to uncover transcriptome-wide intracellular RNA-protein interactions and/or 
RNA modifications at the single-molecule level.</p>
